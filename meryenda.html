                <div class = "card-info">
                    <p>Champorado, also known as tsampurado, is a beloved sweet dish in the Philippines made from sticky rice and tablea, or locally sourced cacao tablets. While it originated from the Mexican champurrado, the Filipino adaptation has been heavily influenced by Chinese culinary traditions. Unlike the Spanish version that uses corn masa, the modern-day recipe employs glutinous rice, which gives the porridge its signature sticky texture.</p>
                    <p>Champorado is typically served as a breakfast or midday snack, often accompanied by salted fish or tuyo to balance the sweetness with some salty flavors. It is also common to enjoy this hearty dish with a side of pandesal or bread to complete the meal. Some Filipinos like to add evaporated milk to their champorado to make it creamier and richer in flavor.</p>
                    <p>Aside from its delicious taste, champorado also carries a significant cultural and historical importance for Filipinos. It is a comforting dish that has been passed down from generation to generation, and continues to be a favorite among both young and old.</p>

                <div class = "card-info">
                    <p>Empanada is a popular pastry dish with a unique half-circle shape that is typically filled with a savory stuffing. Its name has an interesting origin as it comes from the Galician verb empanar, which means "enbreaded" or wrapped in bread. To prepare an empanada, the dough is folded over a filling, which can either be made of meat or vegetables, before baking or frying the dough until crispy. Although the exact origin of empanadas is not clear, it is believed to have originated in Galicia, a region in northwest Spain. Over time, the dish was carried by Spanish colonizers and became popular in Latin America and the Philippines. In the Philippines, empanadas are typically filled with ground meat, potatoes, spices, and raisins. However, this recipe offers a healthy vegetarian alternative, where the soft pocket of dough is stuffed with a delicious and nutritious vegetarian filling.</p>

                    <p>Filipino-style spaghetti is a popular dish in the Philippines, and it has a unique flavor profile that sets it apart from traditional Italian spaghetti. The dish features a sweet and savory tomato-based sauce that includes a variety of ingredients such as ground pork, sliced hot dogs, and sliced Spam. Some versions of the dish may also include banana ketchup, a popular condiment in the Philippines that adds a distinct sweetness to the sauce. The dish is often served with grated cheese on top, which adds a creamy texture and balances out the flavors of the sauce. Filipino-style spaghetti is a staple at Filipino gatherings such as birthday parties and family reunions, and it is often paired with other classic Filipino dishes such as lumpia and fried chicken. While some may find the sweetness of the sauce unusual at first, it has become a beloved comfort food in the Philippines and is a favorite among both children and adults. Filipino-style spaghetti has also gained popularity outside of the Philippines, and many Filipino restaurants around the world offer their own unique take on the dish.</p>
