                <img src = "images/lunch/adobongpusit.jpg" alt = "Adobong Pusit">
                <div class = "card-info">
                    <p>Adobong Pusit is a delicious Filipino squid dish that utilizes the popular adobo method of cooking. To prepare the dish, squid is first boiled in soy sauce and vinegar, giving it a distinct flavor. It is then sautéed with garlic, onions, and tomatoes, which adds more depth to the flavor profile. The resulting dish is a harmonious blend of flavors that will surely excite your taste buds.</p>
                    <p>For best results, it is recommended to use small to medium-sized squids as they have a more intense flavor compared to larger ones. However, finding fresh medium squids can be challenging in some places. </p>
                    <p>This dish has its rich flavor that brings back good memories of home. However, it is important to note that since squid is delicate, overcooking it can make it rubbery in texture. Therefore, it is recommended to follow the indicated cooking time and avoid cooking it for too long. In case the texture becomes rubbery, try cooking it a little more to achieve a tender texture. Overall, this dish is a must-try for anyone who loves seafood and bold flavors.</p>

                    <p>Bulalo is a popular Filipino dish that originates from the Southern Luzon region. It is a light-colored soup that is made by cooking beef shanks and beef marrow bones for hours until much of the collagen and fat has melted into the clear broth. The long cooking process results in a rich and flavorful broth that is perfect for a filling and comforting meal.</p>
                    <p>The seasonings used in Bulalo can vary from chef to chef, with some using only salt and black pepper, while others may add bay leaves, garlic, or patis (fish sauce). The stew is typically made in a large cauldron, and it is best served with whatever vegetables are in season.</p>
                    <p>To make the soup extra clear, a two-boil technique is often used. The first boil removes all the impurities from the beef, while the second boil is a long simmer that extracts all the flavors from the meat and bones. For those who want to save time, a pressure cooker can be used to cut the cooking time by two-thirds, although a heavy-bottomed stock pot or dutch oven can also be used.</p>
                    <p>Bulalo is a versatile dish that can be enjoyed in any weather. Although it is native to a country where the average temperature rarely falls below 80 degrees, the filling stew is deceptively light and can be enjoyed even in warmer weather. The vegetables used in the stew can vary, and some popular options include corn, sayote, baby bok choy, pechay (Chinese cabbage), green beans, potatoes, and carrots.</p>

                    <p>Igado is a traditional dish hailing from the northern region of the Philippines and is widely known for its use of pork tenderloin and pig's innards such as liver, kidney, and heart.

                    <p>The dish itself has a long history and was heavily influenced by Spanish cuisine, as the word "higado" means liver in Spanish. The name "Igado" is said to have originated from Filipinos hearing the Spanish word and adapting it to their own language.

This is then simmered in a mixture of broth and soy sauce until the meat becomes tender and flavorful.</p>
                    <p>To complement the meat components, Igado also includes a few vegetables such as bell peppers and green peas, adding a burst of color and texture to the dish. The result is a savory and hearty stew that is perfect for any occasion, whether it's a family gathering or a casual dinner with friends. While some people may need to acquire a taste for Igado, it is definitely worth trying for anyone who wants to experience the unique and delicious flavors of Filipino cuisine.</p>

                <img src = "images/lunch/porkadobo.jpg" alt = "Pork Adobo">
                <div class = "card-info">
                    <p>Pork adobo is a classic Filipino dish that has Spanish influences. The dish is composed of tender pork cooked in a tangy, savory sauce made with vinegar, garlic, soy sauce, and black pepper. The use of vinegar in the recipe not only adds tanginess to the dish but also acts as a preservative, allowing the meat to last longer.</p>
                    <p>While there are many different variations of adobo across the Philippines, the classic recipe usually involves marinating the meat in the sauce before cooking it. However, this recipe takes a slightly different approach by browning the pork pieces first, which enhances the flavor of the meat. Once the pork is browned, the rest of the ingredients are added and the mixture is left to simmer for at least 45 minutes.</p>
                    <p>This slow cooking process allows the flavors of the sauce to penetrate the meat, making it incredibly tender and flavorful. To give the dish a darker color, dark soy sauce is often used. Additionally, the addition of honey at the end of the cooking process helps to balance out the tanginess of the vinegar and adds a subtle sweetness to the dish.</p>
