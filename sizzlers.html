                <div class = "card-info">
                    <p>Sizzling beef tapa is a flavorful and classic Filipino dish that can be enjoyed any time of the day. It is made by marinating thinly sliced beef with a mixture of calamansi juice, soy sauce, garlic, sugar, salt, and pepper. This marinade is crucial to the dish as it infuses the beef with savory, tangy, and sweet flavors, while also tenderizing it. To cook the tapa, the meat is fried or grilled until it's caramelized, tender, and flavorful.</p>
                    <p>When cooking beef tapa, it's important to cut the meat thinly and across the grain to ensure that it's tender and chewable. Additionally, freezing the meat for a few minutes before slicing it can make the process easier. The marinade should not be left for too long as it can denature the protein fibers and make the meat mushy.</p>
                    <p>Once the beef tapa is ready, it's often served with garlic fried rice and a fried egg, which makes up the popular tapsilog meal. Condiments like spicy vinegar dip, fresh tomato salad, or atchara can be added to enhance the flavor.</p>
                    <p>In recent years, the traditional drying and smoking process for making tapa has been simplified by using marination instead. This allows for a quicker and more convenient process while still producing the same delicious flavor. Beef tapa is a perfect meal for anyone who wants a hearty, flavorful, and filling dish.</p>

                    <p>Sizzling Chicken Sisig is a mouth-watering dish that is easy to prepare and low in fat. It is a chicken version of the traditional Filipino sisig dish that is popular for its flavorful combination of spices and textures. Unlike the original pork sisig recipe that uses fatty parts of the pig, this dish makes use of skinless chicken breast, which is leaner and high in protein. Chicken liver is a key ingredient in this recipe, as it adds a distinct flavor to the dish. While liver is optional, it enhances the taste and adds a rich depth of flavor that truly makes this dish stand out.</p>
                    <p>Preparing this dish is quick and easy. The chicken is first boiled and then grilled or broiled to give it a smoky flavor. It is then chopped into small pieces and mixed with onions, garlic, and other seasonings, including mayonnaise. The dish is served hot on a sizzling plate, which adds a dramatic flair to the dish.</p>
                    <p>For those who are conscious about their fat intake, this dish can be made healthier by adjusting the amount and type of mayonnaise used. Using a low-fat or fat-free version of mayonnaise will help keep the dish light while still maintaining its delicious taste. Sizzling Chicken Sisig is a must-try for anyone who loves bold and flavorful dishes, and it's a perfect meal for any occasion.</p>
